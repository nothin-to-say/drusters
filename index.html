                    Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which falls under
                    the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of
                    the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free
                    and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.

                    Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education,
                    primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies
                    significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste,
                    religion, language, and disability.

                    Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and quality,
                    reducing disparities and dropouts,

                    state subject; states possessed full jurisdiction over making and implementing education policies.
                    After the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution of India was passed in 1976, education fell under the
                    concurrent list.[8] This allowed the central government to recommend education policies and
                    programmes, even if state governments continued to wield extensive autonomy in implementing these
                    programmes.[8] In a country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union territories, this
                    has created vast differences between states in terms of their policies, plans, programmes and
